FOSDEM 2025 eBPF Devroom Call for Participation
===============================================

We are delighted to announce the Call for Participation (CFP) for the very
first eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM!

Mark the Dates
--------------

* **December 1st, 2024: Submission deadline**
* December 15th, 2024: Announcement of accepted talks and schedule
* February 1st, 2025 (Saturday afternoon): eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM

eBPF at FOSDEM
--------------

Originally introduced to make the Linux kernel more programmable, eBPF allows
users to load safe and efficient programs into the kernel, in order to
implement custom logic running on specific events. The main use cases include
kernel or user-space tracing and monitoring, network packet processing,
security policies enforcement, or process scheduling. Today, eBPF also extends
to Windows, user-space runtimes, or hardware offloads. The depth of the
ecosystem has expanded far beyond its original goals and has seen increasing
adoption from both enthusiasts and professionals within the open-source
community, while the list of use cases and eBPF-based projects continues to
grow.

FOSDEM is a free, community-organized event focusing on open source, and aiming
at gathering open source software developers and communities to meet, learn,
and share. It takes place annually in Brussels, Belgium. After hosting a number
of eBPF-related talks in various devrooms over the years, FOSDEM 2025 welcomes
a devroom dedicated to eBPF for the first time! This devroom aims at gathering
talks about various aspects of eBPF, ideally on multiple platforms.

Topics of Interest
------------------

FOSDEM is an event centered on free and open-source software development, and
brings the opportunity to reach a large audience of knowledgeable, highly
technical open-source software activists. If you have something to present
about eBPF, we would love for you to consider submitting a proposal to the
Devroom.

The projects or technologies discussed in the talks **MUST** be open-source.

Topics of interest for the Devroom include (but are not limited to):

* eBPF development: recent or proposed features (on Linux, on other platforms,
  or even cross-platform), such as:
    * eBPF program signing and supply chain security
    * Profiling eBPF with eBPF
    * eBPF-based process schedulers
    * eBPF in storage devices
    * eBPF verifier improvements or alternative implementations
    * Memory management for eBPF
* Deep-dives on existing eBPF features
* Working with eBPF: best practices, common mistakes, debugging, and so on
* eBPF toolchain, for compiling, managing, debugging, packaging, and deploying
  eBPF programs and related objects
* eBPF libraries, in C/C++, Go, Rust, or other languages
* eBPF in the real world, production use cases and their impact
* eBPF community efforts (documentation, standardization, cross-platform
  initiatives)

The list is not exhaustive, don’t hesitate to submit your proposal!

Format
------

FOSDEM 2025 will be an in-person event in Brussels, Belgium.
We do not accept remote presentations.

We’re looking for presentations in one of the following sizes:

* 10 minutes (for example, a short demo)
* 20 minutes (for example, a project update)
* 30 minutes (for example, an introduction to a new technology or a deep dive on a complex feature)

The durations above include time for questions: allow at least 5 to 10 minutes,
depending on the total length, to answer questions from the public.

How to Submit
-------------

Please submit your proposals on [Pretalx], FOSDEM’s submissions tool.

Make sure to **select “eBPF” as the track**.
