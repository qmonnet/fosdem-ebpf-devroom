Dear eBPF Devroom Speakers,

Thanks a lot to all of you for your submissions, and for being part of the
first eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM! It's only 10 days until the Devroom takes place,
and we hope you're all as excited as we are. Here are some considerations
regarding the event.

Slides preparation, talks transition
------------------------------------

We have a packed schedule, in particular we haven't kept some time between the
20-minutes slots for speakers transition between talks, which means we'll need
to do our best to make transitions quick and smooth. To that end:

1. Please be in the room on time to start your presentation.
2. Please ensure that your presentation does not overrun, keep it within the
   allocated 20 minutes (including Q&A time). There will be a hard stop at 20
   minutes.
3. **Please complete and upload your slides to Pretalx by Friday 31st January,
   1pm (Brussels time) at the latest**. This will allow us to retrieve all
   slide sets on a single laptop, and allow speakers to present with that
   laptop without spending time to connect devices and struggle with displays.
4. If you need to use your own device, for example if you intend to show an
   interactive demo during the talk, please let us know as soon as possible.

FOSDEM manuals
--------------

FOSDEM has a “speakers manual” that might be handy, especially if you present
for the first time: https://fosdem.org/2025/manuals/program/speaker/

And if this is your first FOSDEM, you may want to check the website for some
other useful information, such as the commuting info:
https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/

Note that you're also welcome to ask any questions by emailing the FOSDEM
organisers, the Devroom organisers (that's us!), or by asking in one of the
Matrix channels.

Evening event
-------------

We're looking into organising an evening event for the speakers and organisers
of the eBPF Devroom, so we can get together on the Saturday evening. We were
looking at a speakers' dinner, but we're struggling to find a restaurant with
enough seats, so this might be just going to a pub downtown in Brussels after
the end of the eBPF session. To be confirmed; you'll get more details as soon
as possible.

Just so that we could get an estimate of the number of people who would come,
**please let us know whether you're available or not to join us for a dinner or
a drink on the Saturday evening**.

We're looking forward to seeing you all very soon,
Quentin - on behalf of the eBPF Devroom organisers
